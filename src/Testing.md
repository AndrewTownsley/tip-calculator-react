Testing Plan...

**_ Start with each Component _**

**_ Then do the click handlers _**

**_ Then conditionally rendered elements _**

**_ Then individual functions _**

1.  Identify the features which add more business value to your application and carry out testing. For example, in the case of the Netflix application, searching for a movie and playing the video is an important feature. So, consider that area as a prioritized feature to test.

2.  Execute border case/edge case scenarios in those high valued features.

3.  Identify the most used React components in your application and test those.

4.  If your application serves a large user base, such as Netflix or Amazon, ensure to test the application for stress and performance load.

5.  Include the testing scope for basic React component testing, which includes:
    User interactions with the components, such as OnClick or OnSubmit events
    Conditional renderings such as impact due to State changes or Prop changes

6.  React hooks (if hooks are defined in your React apps)
